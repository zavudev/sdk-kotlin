/**
 * Type of message. Non-text types are supported by WhatsApp and Telegram (varies by type).
 *
 * `location_request` asks the recipient to share their location and is WhatsApp-only. It takes no
 * `content` object — the prompt goes in `text` (max 1024 characters) and the button label is fixed
 * by WhatsApp. The recipient's answer arrives as an inbound `location` message whose
 * `content.replyToMessageId` is the ID of the request.
 *
 * `request_contact_info` asks the recipient to share their phone number and is WhatsApp-only. Like
 * `location_request` it takes no `content` object — the prompt goes in `text` (max 1024 characters)
 * and WhatsApp renders a fixed **Share Contact Info** button. The answer arrives as an inbound
 * `contact` message. Use it to recover the phone number of a contact who adopted a WhatsApp
 * username and is only known by their business-scoped user ID (BSUID); when they share it, Zavu
 * automatically links the phone number to that contact.
