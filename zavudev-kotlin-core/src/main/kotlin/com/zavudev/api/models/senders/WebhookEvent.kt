/**
 * Type of event that triggers the webhook.
 *
 * **Message lifecycle events:**
 * - `message.queued`: Message created and queued for sending. `data.status` = `queued`
 * - `message.sent`: Message accepted by the provider. `data.status` = `sent`
 * - `message.delivered`: Message delivered to recipient. `data.status` = `delivered`
 * - `message.read`: Message was read by the recipient (WhatsApp only). `data.status` = `read`
 * - `message.failed`: Message failed to send. `data.status` = `failed`
 *
 * **Inbound events:**
 * - `message.inbound`: New message received from a contact. `data.conversationId` is the inbox
 *   thread id (deep-link with `https://dashboard.zavu.dev/{locale}/inbox?conv={conversationId}`);
 *   it is `null` while the conversation row is still being created (the first message of a
 *   brand-new thread, or several near-simultaneous first messages), where `conversation.new`
 *   carries the id instead — `GET /v1/messages/{messageId}` always has it. Reactions are delivered
 *   as `message.inbound` with `messageType='reaction'`. When the contact replied to (quoted) an
 *   earlier message, `data.content` carries the reply context: `replyToMessageId`,
 *   `replyToProviderMessageId`, `replyToFrom`, `replyToText`, and `replyToMessageType`.
 *   `data.providerTimestamp` is the provider's original receive time in Unix milliseconds (the
 *   moment the channel received the message from the contact — WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram,
 *   Messenger; `null` for SMS and email). Compare it against the top-level `timestamp` (when Zavu
 *   dispatched the webhook) to detect and ignore delayed deliveries.
 * - `message.unsupported`: Received a message type that is not supported
 *
 * **Broadcast events:**
 * - `broadcast.status_changed`: Broadcast status changed (pending_review, approved, rejected,
 *   sending, completed, cancelled)
 *
 * **Other events:**
 * - `conversation.new`: New conversation started with a contact. `data` carries `conversationId`
 *   (the inbox thread id — deep-link with
 *   `https://dashboard.zavu.dev/{locale}/inbox?conv={conversationId}`), the `phoneNumber` or
 *   `email` key, `channel`, `firstMessageId`, `firstMessageText`, and `profileName`.
 * - `template.status_changed`: WhatsApp template approval status changed
 *
 * **Partner events:**
 * - `invitation.status_changed`: A partner invitation status changed (pending, in_progress,
 *   completed, cancelled, failed). `data` carries `invitationId`, `clientName`, `clientEmail`,
 *   `connectionType` (`whatsapp_waba` or `messenger`), `previousStatus`, and `currentStatus`. On
 *   `completed` it also carries `senderId` and `connectedAccount` (`channel`, `id`, `name`) — the
 *   WhatsApp number or Facebook Page that was linked. On `failed` it carries `failureReason`; the
 *   invitation link stays usable, so a client can retry it.
 *
 * **Voice Agent events:** For every voice event, `data` carries `callId`, `direction`, `from`,
 * `to`, `status`, `durationSeconds`, `endReason`, and `transcriptAvailable`. The terminal events
 * (`call.completed`, `call.failed`) additionally carry `cost` — what the call was billed, in USD,
 * combining telephony and the managed voice pipeline — and `currency`. They are dispatched after
 * the call is charged, so `cost` is populated rather than zero; telephony can still be settling on
 * an outbound call, in which case `GET /v1/calls/{callId}` holds the reconciled figure.
 * - `call.initiated`: An outbound call was created and is dialing, or an inbound call was received.
 *   `data.status` = `ringing`
 * - `call.answered`: The call was answered and the voice agent is connected. `data.status` =
 *   `in_progress`
 * - `call.completed`: The call ended after a conversation. `data.status` = `completed`;
 *   `durationSeconds` and `endReason` describe how it ended, and `transcriptAvailable` indicates
 *   whether a transcript can be fetched.
 * - `call.failed`: The call could not be completed (busy, no answer, canceled, or an error).
 *   `data.status` is the terminal status and `endReason` explains the cause.
 *
 * **Custom domain events:**
 * - `domain.verified`: A custom email domain passed verification (DKIM, and SPF/DMARC/MAIL FROM if
 *   enhanced records are enabled)
 * - `domain.failed`: A custom email domain failed verification or is partially verified
