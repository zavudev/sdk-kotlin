/**
 * Purchase an available phone number. Requires a paid plan: the Free plan cannot purchase phone
 * numbers and receives `402` with code `paid_plan_required`.
 *
 * **The included number.** A paid plan includes one number at no charge, once per account: it must
 * be a US or Canadian number (a +1 number) costing $20 a month or less. `isFreeEligible` in `GET
 * /v1/phone-numbers/available` marks the numbers that qualify. Claiming it spends the benefit for
 * good, across every team the account owner owns, so releasing that number does not make another
 * one free.
 *
 * **Numbers with regulatory requirements.** Which numbers need regulatory information is decided
 * per number, not by a fixed country list. The purchase looks the requirements up for the exact
 * number before charging anything:
 * 1. `GET /v1/phone-numbers/requirements?phoneNumber=...`. If `items` is empty, buy normally.
 * 2. Create what it asks for: addresses with `POST /v1/addresses`, documents with `POST
 *    /v1/documents`.
 * 3. Purchase with `type` and `regulatoryRequirements`. The number is bought and billed at once
 *    with `regulatoryStatus: pending_review`.
 * 4. Poll `GET /v1/phone-numbers/{phoneNumberId}` until `regulatoryStatus` is `approved`. Assign it
 *    to a sender before or after approval; it starts carrying messages once approved.
 *
 * **Reuse.** Information you submitted is kept for your project, per country and `type`, and a
 * later purchase there may omit `regulatoryRequirements`. Reuse only happens when what is kept
 * still covers every requirement of the new number and every address and document in it belongs to
 * the project. Otherwise, or when nothing is kept, the purchase returns `400
 * regulatory_compliance_required` with the missing requirements in `details`.
 *
 * Invalid values (a missing, unknown or repeated requirement id, an address or document from
 * another project, or one rejected in review) return `400 invalid_request`. If an address or
 * document cannot be registered for review, the purchase returns `400 invalid_request` naming the
 * requirement. If the requirements cannot be looked up, the purchase returns `502
 * requirements_unavailable`, except for US and Canadian numbers, which are sold as numbers without
 * requirements. None of these errors charge anything.
