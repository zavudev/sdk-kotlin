/**
 * Send a message to a recipient via SMS or WhatsApp.
 *
 * **Channel selection:**
 * - If `channel` is omitted and `messageType` is `text`, defaults to SMS
 * - If `messageType` is anything other than `text`, WhatsApp is used automatically
 *
 * **WhatsApp 24-hour window:**
 * - Free-form messages (non-template) require an open 24h window
 * - Window opens when the user messages you first
 * - Use template messages to initiate conversations outside the window
 *
 * **Plan allowances and email billing:**
 * - WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram and Messenger share an allowance of 2,000 messages per month on
 *   Free. Over it, sends return 429 with code `a2p_limit_exceeded` and upgrade details; the counter
 *   resets on the 1st of each month. Paid plans have no message caps
 * - Email is billed from your prepaid balance in 1,000-message blocks: $0.40 per 1,000
 *   transactional emails, $0.80 per 1,000 marketing (broadcast) emails. A block is charged when
 *   your monthly count crosses each 1,000 boundary, and at zero balance email sends return 402 with
 *   code `insufficient_balance`. Free teams start with $2 of credit and additionally cap at 3,000
 *   emails/month and 100/day. Teams on earlier plans keep their original email quotas instead
 * - SMS and voice are billed per message from your balance on every plan
 *
 * **Account verification and daily limits:**
 * - A brand-new account can send on every channel immediately, but `sms`, `sms_oneway` and `voice`
 *   reach only the phone numbers the project has verified. Sending elsewhere returns `403` with
 *   code `destination_not_verified`; `details.verifiedNumbers` lists the numbers that are
 *   reachable. A number is verified from the dashboard's Sandbox screen: generate a code and send
 *   the pre-filled WhatsApp message from that phone to Zavu's sandbox number. One verification
 *   covers WhatsApp, SMS and calls, up to 5 numbers per project. To send to any destination, do any
 *   one of these: verify your identity, add a payment method, settle a deposit, or subscribe to a
 *   paid plan. Business verification (KYB) is never required to send
 * - Daily ceilings apply per channel group and rise with verification. An account that has verified
 *   nothing: 25/day across `sms` + `sms_oneway`, 5/day for `voice`, 100/day across WhatsApp,
 *   Telegram, Instagram and Messenger combined. Past that floor: 200/day for SMS, or 10,000/day
 *   once identity or business verification is approved (or a higher limit agreed for your account);
 *   50/day voice and 250/day conversational on Free. **Paid plans have no voice or conversational
 *   daily ceiling.** Over a ceiling, sends return `429` with code `daily_limit_exceeded` and
 *   `details.limit`; the count resets at 00:00 UTC
 * - The daily ceiling never reduces the monthly allowance: 100/day on the conversational group
 *   still reaches the 2,000 monthly A2P messages Free includes
 * - Email needs no account verification here: a sender with a verified domain sends from day one,
 *   within the plan quota (100/day and 3,000/month on Free). Over the daily quota it returns `429`
 *   with code `daily_limit_exceeded`. Email broadcasts are the exception: they need the account
 *   past the sandbox level, see `POST /v1/broadcasts/{broadcastId}/send`
 * - Full reference: https://docs.zavu.dev/concepts/sending-limits
 *
 * **Email recipient pre-flight:** Email messages are validated automatically before dispatch. Sends
 * that would be a guaranteed hard bounce are failed instead of sent, protecting your bounce rate:
 * the message transitions to `failed` (visible via `GET /v1/messages/{messageId}` and the
 * `message.failed` webhook) with `errorCode` set to `EMAIL_INVALID_RECIPIENT` (malformed address),
 * `EMAIL_DOMAIN_NOT_FOUND` (recipient domain has no MX or A records), or
 * `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_SUPPRESSED` (address is on your suppression list after a previous bounce or
 * complaint). Advisory signals (role addresses, disposable domains) do not block sends — check them
 * beforehand with `POST /v1/introspect/email`.
